## Stress tester

Imagine how it could be stressing a system with a million request, this could be hard doing it manually , so i did a tool to stress an endpoing with a million requests or more,

May be million `POST` requests, not as fast as it could be but doing the JOB. but also remember that the speed depend on the server you are hiting, if the server can respond `POST` request in less than 10ms other server respond in 900ms of course the app is going to depend on response of the server.
